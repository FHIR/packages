Occupation CDC Census 2010	PHVS_Occupation_CDC_Census2010	2.16.840.1.114222.4.11.7186	1	2010 Occupation coding system used by CDC (NIOSH & NCHS) for coding occupation text.  Occupation describes a set of activities or tasks that individuals are paid to perform or, if unpaid, define a person’s contribution to a household/family business/community.  This code system includes  2010 U.S. Census Bureau occupation codes with modifications made by CDC for unpaid workers and military occupations.  The 2010 Census occupation categories  are based on the 2010 BLS Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system.  The PH_Industry_CDC_Census2010  code system should be used in conjunction with this occupation code system when coding both industry and occupation.  For more information and instructions on using this coding system, see the instruction manual for CDC-Census I&O coding at:  http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coding/	Published	08/23/2013	v1
