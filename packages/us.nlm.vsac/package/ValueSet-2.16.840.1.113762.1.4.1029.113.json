  "description" : "This value set was developed for a total hip and total knee replacement measure set.  Feasibility testing revealed that a large percentage of this patient population do participate in clinical trials.  The field asked that clinical trial participants remain in the measure set as the typical trials do not have an impact on what is being measured.  Therefore, this \"medical reason for not\" value set does not include clinical trials.\n\nNOTE:  VALUE SET UNDER DEVELOPMENT AS MEASURE TESTING IS ONGOING.",
