  "purpose" : "(Clinical Focus: This value set identifies specific procedures for medical management of abortion, focusing on methods that utilize medications to terminate a pregnancy.),(Data Element Scope: This data element captures the specific technique used for medical management abortion, reported from a healthcare provider's perspective. It indicates the chosen medication administration route (intra-amniotic injection or vaginal suppository) and any subsequent surgical interventions that may be required.),(Inclusion Criteria: This value set includes concepts representing the following medical management abortion procedures:\n\nInduced abortion using one or more intra-amniotic injections (amniocentesis) to terminate a pregnancy. This includes codes encompassing:\nHospital admission and necessary visits.\nDelivery of the fetus and placenta (secundines).\nPotential need for additional procedures like dilation and curettage (D&C) or evacuation in case of incomplete abortion.\nInduced abortion using one or more vaginal suppositories containing medications like prostaglandins, with or without cervical dilation techniques (laminaria). This includes codes encompassing:\nHospital admission and necessary visits.\nDelivery of the fetus and placenta (secundines).\nPotential need for additional procedures like dilation and curettage (D&C) or evacuation in case of incomplete abortion.\nNeed for a hysterotomy (surgical incision into the uterus) if the initial medical management fails to achieve complete abortion.),(Exclusion Criteria: This value set excludes concepts related to:\n\nSurgical abortion procedures (e.g., vacuum aspiration, dilation and evacuation).\n\nOther pregnancy termination methods not involving medications (e.g., medical conditions leading to spontaneous abortion).\nBy including these specific criteria, this value set ensures accurate capture of data on medical management abortion techniques used in a healthcare setting.)",
