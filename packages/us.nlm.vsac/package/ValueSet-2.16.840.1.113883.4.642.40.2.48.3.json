  "description" : "The HL7 OID used in the US Core Implementation Guide value set (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/omb-ethnicity-category) has been retained here, as the value set content is identical. However, the preferred reference is now the VSAC-hosted version, since both US Core and C-CDA will reference this set going forward. Additionally, the US Core IG-based value set does not currently support expansion, making the VSAC version more suitable for implementation.",

It also includes the ability to document when ethnicity is unknown or when the individual does not know or declines to provide this information.),(Inclusion Criteria: Includes codes from the CDCREC code system that represent Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino, along with HL7 nullFlavor codes ASKU (asked but unknown) and UNK (unknown) and Asked-Declined from the FHIR Data Absent Reason Code system.),(Exclusion Criteria: No other CDCREC codes or HL7 Null values are included.)",
