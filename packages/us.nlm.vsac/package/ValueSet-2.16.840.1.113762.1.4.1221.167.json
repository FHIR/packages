  "purpose" : "(Clinical Focus: This value set encompasses concepts related to various surgical procedures used for pregnancy termination or management of miscarriage across all trimesters.),(Data Element Scope: This data element captures the surgical approach to address a range of pregnancy complications, including: Termination of pregnancy (induced abortion) Management of missed miscarriage (where the fetus has died but the body hasn't expelled it) Treatment of incomplete abortion (where some pregnancy tissue remains after a spontaneous or attempted termination) Removal of a hydatidiform mole (an abnormal fertilized egg)),(Inclusion Criteria: This value set includes specific surgical procedures for pregnancy termination or management: Dilation and curettage (D&C) and dilation and evacuation (D&E): Techniques used to remove pregnancy tissue through the cervix. Hysterotomy (abdominal): Surgical incision into the uterus, typically for hydatidiform mole or late-term miscarriage. Surgical treatment of miscarriage: Procedures to remove pregnancy tissue across trimesters (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).),(Exclusion Criteria: This value set excludes non-surgical methods of pregnancy termination (e.g., medical management with medication). Additionally, procedures unrelated to pregnancy termination are not included (e.g., exploratory laparotomy).)",
