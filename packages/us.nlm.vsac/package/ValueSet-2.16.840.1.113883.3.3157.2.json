Patients are eligible for inclusion in the OP-10 measure denominator if their provider performs an abdomen/abdominopelvic CT without contrast, with contrast, or without then with contrast. Patients are eligible for inclusion in the OP-10 measure numerator if their provider performs an abdomen/abdominopelvic CT with contrast.\nPlease reference the OP-10 annual reevaluation report for more details on the measure's denominator, numerator, and exclusion criteria.",
