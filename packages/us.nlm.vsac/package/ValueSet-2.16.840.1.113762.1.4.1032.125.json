  "purpose" : "(Clinical Focus: Codes associated with alcohol use disorder (i.e., alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence)),(Data Element Scope: This value set includes ICD10-CM codes that represent alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence diagnoses (as outlined by DSM-IV criteria). Per DSM-5, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are now grouped into a single disorder (i.e., AUD). At present, ICD10-CM codes that represent \"mild\", \"moderate\" and \"severe\" AUD are not available. Implementers can find guidance on how to map \"mild\", \"moderate\", and \"severe\" AUD to alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence codes here: https://icd10cmtool.cdc.gov/?fy=FY2020&q=alcohol%20use and DSM details here: https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/alcohol-use-disorder-comparison-between-dsm.),(Inclusion Criteria: ICD10-CM codes that represent alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence diagnoses (which together define AUD).),(Exclusion Criteria: Codes that depict 1) alcohol use (without mention of abuse, dependence or disorder), 2) alcohol-induced disorders (e.g., alcohol induced persisting dementia) that do not include mention of alcohol abuse, 3) alcohol-related effects (e.g., hepatic cirrhosis), and 4) AUD, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence that is in remission or no longer active.)",
