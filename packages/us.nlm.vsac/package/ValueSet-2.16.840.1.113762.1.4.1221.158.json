  "purpose" : "(Clinical Focus: The purpose of this value set is to represent concepts related to failed attempted induced abortion procedures and their associated complications. It covers unsuccessful pregnancy termination attempts as well as the various potential sequelae and adverse effects that can result.),(Data Element Scope: This value set is intended for use with data elements related to obstetric procedures, pregnancy complications, and reasons for healthcare encounters within electronic health records or clinical quality measures. The included concepts span the Procedure, Condition, and Diagnosis semantic categories.),(Inclusion Criteria: Included are concepts explicitly describing a failed attempted induced abortion as well as specific complications that may arise, such as infections, hemorrhage, embolism, shock, organ damage, sepsis, and other systemic disorders. Both the unsuccessful procedure itself and the subsequent complications are incorporated.),(Exclusion Criteria: Any concepts related to successful induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, or missed abortions are excluded from this value set. Concepts describing therapeutic procedures or management for the failed attempt complications are also excluded if they do not explicitly reference the original failed termination attempt. General obstetric or pregnancy concepts not specific to failed abortion attempts are omitted.)",
