  "purpose" : "(Clinical Focus: The purpose of this value set is to represent induced abortion procedures occurring during the third trimester of pregnancy, defined as from 28 completed weeks of gestation until delivery. It covers late-stage induced termination procedures within the specified gestational age ranges.),(Data Element Scope: This value set is intended for use with data elements related to obstetric procedures and pregnancy termination within electronic health records or clinical quality measures. The included concepts belong to the Procedure semantic category.),(Inclusion Criteria: Included are two concepts that explicitly describe induced abortion procedures performed at 29-31 weeks gestation and 32 weeks gestation or later. These concepts capture induced abortions falling within the third trimester time period after 28 completed weeks.),(Exclusion Criteria: Concepts related to induced abortions prior to the third trimester (less than 29 weeks) are excluded, as are any concepts for spontaneous abortions, missed abortions, or other non-induced pregnancy terminations. The value set is narrowly focused on late third trimester induced procedures only. Additional clinical details, methods, indications, or associated conditions are not included. General third trimester concepts not specifying the gestational week ranges are omitted.)",
