  "description" : "This value set is used to calculate OP-10 (Abdomen CT—Use of Contrast Material), a claims-based measure used in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (HOQR) Program. Patients are eligible for inclusion in the OP-10 measure denominator if their provider performs an abdomen/abdominopelvic CT without contrast, with contrast, or without then with contrast. Patients are eligible for inclusion in the OP-10 measure numerator if their provider performs an abdomen/abdominopelvic CT without contrast then with contrast.\nPlease reference the OP-10 annual reevaluation report for more details on the measure's denominator, numerator, and exclusion criteria.",
