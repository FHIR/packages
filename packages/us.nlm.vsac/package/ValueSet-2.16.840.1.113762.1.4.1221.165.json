The concept would belong to the Condition semantic category.),(Inclusion Criteria: This concept covers induced abortion procedures performed voluntarily and not due to fetal anomalies, maternal health risks, or other clinical indications.),(Exclusion Criteria: Any concepts related to spontaneous abortions, missed abortions, or induced abortions performed for fetal anomalies, maternal health risks, or other medical reasons are explicitly excluded from this value set. Concepts describing additional details about the abortion procedure method, gestational age, or other clinical characteristics are not included. The value set is intentionally narrow to capture only elective, non-medically necessary induced abortion encounters.)",
