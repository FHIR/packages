  "purpose" : "(Clinical Focus: The purpose of this value set is to comprehensively represent induced abortion procedures performed across all gestational age ranges using various surgical and medication methods. It covers the full spectrum of techniques for intentionally terminating a pregnancy.),(Data Element Scope: This value set is intended for use with data elements related to obstetric procedures, pregnancy termination, and associated services within electronic health records or clinical quality measures. The included concepts primarily belong to the Procedure semantic category.),(Inclusion Criteria: The value set includes concepts that detail:\n- Surgical induced abortion approaches like dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation, intra-amniotic injections\n- Medication induced abortion using oral medications or vaginal suppositories (e.g. prostaglandins) \n- Potential adjunct, follow-up, or alternative procedures like hysterotomy, cervical dilation, ultrasounds\n- Perioperative services like anesthesia administration\n- Gestational age ranges from 17 weeks through 32 weeks or greater for induced abortions\n\nIt aims to incorporate concepts covering all commonly used induced abortion methods and timeframes.),(Exclusion Criteria: Any concepts specifically related to only spontaneous abortions, missed abortions, failed abortion attempts or complications are excluded. Concepts only describing reasons, indications or associated conditions without referencing the termination procedure are also omitted. General pregnancy care or obstetric concepts not specific to induced abortions are excluded.)",
