It specifies:\n\nContraceptive Type: Identifies the specific contraception method being monitored (e.g., oral contraceptive pills, IUD, vaginal ring).\nSurveillance Reason: Distinguishes between different reasons for the encounter, such as routine check-up, side effect management, or assessing contraceptive effectiveness.),(Inclusion Criteria: This value set includes a comprehensive list of concepts related to contraceptive surveillance:\n\nContraceptive Methods: Covers monitoring of various contraceptive types:\nOral contraceptive pills (including those used for non-contraceptive purposes)\nInjectable contraceptives (depot medroxyprogesterone)\nSubcutaneous contraceptive implants\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs)\nVaginal pessaries\nVaginal hormone-releasing rings\nOther contraceptives (broader category for less common methods)\nSurveillance Reasons: Captures different purposes for follow-up visits:\nSurveillance of the prescribed contraceptive method (general term)\nSurveillance of a specific type of contraception (e.g., IUD, vaginal ring)\nRoutine check-up of the contraception\nMonitoring for side effects or complications\nAssessing contraceptive effectiveness),(Exclusion Criteria: This value set excludes encounters related to initial prescription, insertion, or removal of contraceptives (covered in separate value sets). It also excludes procedures like IUD insertion or removal, which are distinct from surveillance encounters.)",
