These values are used in calculating a performance measure based on diagnostic CT radiation dose and image quality.),(Data Element Scope: These data elements will be used for exclusion logic in our eCQM),(Inclusion Criteria: CPT codes for concurrent nuclear medicine and CT are included in this set (which is used for exclusion in our eCQM)),(Exclusion Criteria: N/A)",
