These values are used in calculating a performance measure based on diagnostic CT radiation dose and image quality.),(Data Element Scope: These data elements will be used for exclusion logic in our eCQM),(Inclusion Criteria: Non-Diagnostic CPT codes are included in this set, which is used for exclusion logic in the eCQM),(Exclusion Criteria: N/A)",
