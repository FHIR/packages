Natural latex is an extract of the rubber tree (H. brasiliensis) and contains the allergens responsible for latex hyper-sensitivity reactions. Products that may contain NRL are medical gloves and condoms. See 21 CFR 801.437 for full regulatory definition.),(Exclusion Criteria: Natural rubber latex was not used as materials in the manufacture of the medical product and container and the device labeling contains this information. This set is only applicable to devices not subject to the requirements under 21 CFR 801.437. Not all medical products that are NOT made with natural rubber latex will be marked.)",
