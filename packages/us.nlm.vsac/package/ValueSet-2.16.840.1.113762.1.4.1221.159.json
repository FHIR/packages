  "purpose" : "(Clinical Focus: The purpose of this value set is to represent various medical procedures and methods for inducing an abortion or terminating a pregnancy. It covers both surgical and medication abortion techniques across different clinical settings.),(Data Element Scope: This value set is intended for use with data elements related to obstetric procedures and pregnancy termination within electronic health records or clinical quality measures. All of the included concepts belong to the Procedure semantic category.),(Inclusion Criteria: The value set includes concepts describing different approaches to induced abortion:\n- Surgical procedures like dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation\n- Medication induction using intra-amniotic injections or vaginal suppositories (e.g. prostaglandins)\n- Potential adjunct procedures like cervical dilation or hysterotomy\n- Perioperative services like anesthesia administration\n\nThe concepts cover induced abortions in various treatment settings (e.g. hospital admission) and account for incomplete/failed procedures requiring further intervention.),(Exclusion Criteria: Any concepts related to spontaneous abortions, missed abortions, or elective/non-medical reasons for termination are excluded. Concepts describing diagnostic procedures, complications management, or follow-up care not directly involving the termination method are also excluded. General pregnancy condition or obstetric concepts not specific to the induced abortion procedure are omitted.)",
