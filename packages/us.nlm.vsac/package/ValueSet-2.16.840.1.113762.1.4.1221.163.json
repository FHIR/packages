It signifies the complete course of care provided, encompassing counseling, confirmation of pregnancy, monitoring of progress, and verification of completion.),(Inclusion Criteria: This value set includes concepts representing all essential services and supplies utilized during a medical management abortion. These services encompass:\n\nPatient counseling regarding the procedure, risks, and benefits.\nOffice visits for evaluation, medication administration, and monitoring.\nConfirmation of pregnancy using hCG testing.\nUltrasound examinations to determine gestational age and confirm abortion completion.),(Exclusion Criteria: The specific medications used for medical management abortion are excluded from this value set. This is because medication regimens may vary based on clinical factors and practice guidelines. A separate value set focusing specifically on the medications used in this procedure would be more appropriate.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nThis value set emphasizes the comprehensive nature of medical management abortion, capturing all necessary services and supplies besides the medications themselves.\nThe inclusion criteria highlight the importance of counseling, confirmation of pregnancy, and monitoring for patient safety and successful completion of the procedure.)",
