  "purpose" : "(Clinical Focus: The purpose of this value set is to represent concepts related to induced abortion procedures across all gestational age ranges, including both medication and surgical termination methods.),(Data Element Scope: This value set is intended for use with data elements related to obstetric procedures, pregnancy termination, and associated services within electronic health records or clinical quality measures. The included concepts belong primarily to the Procedure semantic category.),(Inclusion Criteria: This value set includes key concepts covering:\n1. Medication induced abortions using oral medications, along with associated services like counseling, pregnancy confirmation, and follow-up ultrasounds.\n2. Gestational age ranges for induced surgical/procedural abortions from 17 weeks through 32 weeks or greater.),(Exclusion Criteria: Concepts related to spontaneous abortions, missed abortions, or failed abortion attempts are excluded from this value set. While the medication abortion concept covers associated services, no additional concepts for specific procedure steps, methods, or complications are incorporated. The value set does not distinguish between elective and medically indicated induced abortions. General pregnancy condition concepts are also excluded if they do not explicitly reference an induced termination procedure.)",
