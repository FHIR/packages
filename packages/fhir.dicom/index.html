<h2>The FHIR DICOM Package (fhir.dicom)</h2>

<p>
The FHIR DICOM package contains all the DICOM FHIR Value sets generated as part of
the DICOM standard, and the DICOM code system itself.
</p>

<h3>Releases</h3>

<ul id="releases-list">
  <li><a href="2022.1.20220124/package.tgz">2022.1.20220124</a>: First release for 2022a (2022-01-24)</li>
  <li><a href="2021.4.20210910/package.tgz">2021.4.20210910</a>: First release for 2021d (2021-10-30)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Versioning</h3>

<p>
The version is automatically derived from the DICOM internal version number
linked to the release. The format is semver value:
</p>
<pre>
{year}.{release}.{date}
</pre>
<p>
Notes:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>The year will have a format like 2021</li>
 <li>The release is 1, 2, 3, 4 following Dicom's a, b, c, d release e.g. 2021.4 corresponds do 2021d release</li>
 <li>The date is the date of release and is yyyymmdd - no time is included</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that if you want the latest version, don't specify a version when you use the package.
</p>

<h3>Generating the Package</h3>

<p>
Anyone can generate their own copy of the package, but only the FHIR Product Director or authorised
delegate can release a new package. To generate the package:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an FTP client to make a local copy of <a href="ftp://medical.nema.org/MEDICAL/Dicom/Resources">ftp://medical.nema.org/MEDICAL/Dicom/Resources</a></li>
<li>Run the IG publisher with the parameters -dicom-gen -src {folder} -dst {folder}</li>
<li>Use the generated output in the file 
</ul>

<p>
If, for some reason, you need an older package released from before this system existed (Oct 2021),
talk to the David Clunie to assemble the correct source (value sets and OWL file) and then 
talk to Grahame Grieve to get the old package published.
</p>
