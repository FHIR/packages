This category includes observations resulting from interventional and non-interventional procedures excluding laboratory and imaging (e.g., cardiology catheterization, endoscopy, electrodiagnostics, etc.).  Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician to provide more granular information about component observations made during a procedure.  An example would be when a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.</td>
