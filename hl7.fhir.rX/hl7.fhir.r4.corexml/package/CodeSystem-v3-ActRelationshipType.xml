For example, sending a Document act as the result of an imaging observation, sending a list of Procedures and/or other acts as the result of a medical history observation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;                        The valueNegationInd attribute on the source Act has the same semantics of &quot;negated finding&quot; when it applies to the target of a VALUE ActRelationship as it does to the value attribute.  On the other hand, if the ActRelationship.negationInd is true for a VALUE ActRelationship, that means the specified observation does not have the indicated value but does not imply a negated finding.  Because the semantics are extremely close, it is recommended that Observation.valueNegationInd be used, not ActRelationship.negationInd.&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;                        &#xA;                           OpenIssue: The implications of negationInd on ActRelationship and the valueNegationind on Observation."/></concept></concept><concept><code value="CURE"/><display value="curative indication"/><definition value="curative indication"/><property><code value="status"/><valueCode value="retired"/></property></concept><concept><code value="CURE.ADJ"/><display value="adjunct curative indication"/><definition value="adjunct curative indication"/><property><code value="status"/><valueCode value="retired"/></property></concept><concept><code value="MTGT.ADJ"/><display value="adjunct mitigation"/><definition value="adjunct mitigation"/><property><code value="status"/><valueCode value="retired"/></property></concept><concept><code value="RACT"/><property><code value="status"/><valueCode value="retired"/></property></concept><concept><code value="SUGG"/><property><code value="status"/><valueCode value="retired"/></property></concept></CodeSystem>
