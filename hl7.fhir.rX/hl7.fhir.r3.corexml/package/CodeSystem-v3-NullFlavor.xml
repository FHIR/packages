However, it may apply to *any* datatype where the constraints of the type are tighter than can be conveyed.  For example, a PQ that is for a true measured amount whose units are not supported in UCUM, a need to convey a REAL when the type has been constrained to INT, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;                        With coded datatypes, this null flavor may only be used if the vocabulary binding has a coding strength of CNE.
