Constraints:&#xD;&#xA;The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems.  The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc. Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure. Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code &quot;potassium&quot; together with and Act.classCode for &quot;laboratory observation&quot; to somehow mean &quot;potassium laboratory observation&quot; and then use the same Act.code for &quot;potassium&quot; together with Act.classCode for &quot;medication&quot; to mean &quot;substitution of potassium&quot;. This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted."/><caseSensitive value="true"/><valueSet value="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ActCode"/><hierarchyMeaning value="is-a"/><content value="complete"/><property><code value="notSelectable"/><uri value="http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#notSelectable"/><description value="Indicates that the code is abstract - only intended to be used as a selector for other concepts"/><type value="boolean"/></property><property><code value="inactive"/><uri value="http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#inactive"/><description value="True if the concept is not considered active - e.g. not a valid concept any more"/><type value="boolean"/></property><property><code value="deprecated"/><uri value="http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#deprecated"/><description value="The date at which a concept was deprecated.

Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions.  The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly.  A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss.  An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer.  A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;                        &#xA;                           Discussion: In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy.  The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer.  A subscriber of a self-insured health insurance policy is a policy holder.  A subscriber of an employer sponsored health insurance policy is holds a certificate of coverage, but is not a policy holder; the policy holder is the employer.

Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years)."/><concept><code value="ANNU"/><display value="annuity policy"/><definition value="Definition: A policy that, after an initial premium or premiums, pays out a sum at pre-determined intervals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;                        For example, a policy holder may pay $10,000, and in return receive $150 each month until he dies; or $1,000 for each of 14 years or death benefits if he dies before the full term of the annuity has elapsed."/></concept><concept><code value="TLIFE"/><display value="term life insurance policy"/><definition value="Definition: Life insurance under which the benefit is payable only if the insured dies during a specified period.

Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;                        For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured&#39;s particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description:  Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles.  A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a &#39;policy domain&#39;) through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy).   These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine.  A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy.  When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver&#39;s responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information.  This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;                        &#xA;                           Usage Note: Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements.  For example, an employee&#39;s sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   &#39;Taboo&#39; would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly.  Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system&#39;s Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient&#39;s orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy&#39;s criteria directly.  The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title."/><property><code value="notSelectable"/><valueBoolean value="true"/></property><concept><code value="_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy"/><display value="ActInformationSensitivityPolicy"/><definition value="Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Acts.
