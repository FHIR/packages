The identifier references an event that links to a single biological entity such as a blood donor, or to multiple biological entities (e.g. when the product is an embryo or a pooled platelet product).  A single biologicalSourceEvent identifier may appear on multiple products of many types derived from a single donation event or source extraction.  As an example, a single donation event may provide 2 kidneys and a liver for organ transplantation, 2 corneas for eye surgery, heart valves and arterial tissue for cardiovascular surgery, multiple skin grafts, tendons, multiple shaped bone grafts and a large number of bone putty/paste products; and each of them may be assigned to the same biological source event identifier.","constraint":[{"expression":"hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())","human":"All FHIR elements must have a @value or children","key":"ele-1","severity":"error","source":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Element","xpath":"@value|f:*|h:div"}],"definition":"An identifier that supports traceability to the event during which material in this product from one or more biological entities was obtained or pooled.","id":"BiologicallyDerivedProduct.biologicalSourceEvent","isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"w5","map":"FiveWs.identifier"},{"identity":"ISBT128Code","map":"Donation Identification Number.

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.\n\nModifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).\">modifierExtension</a></td></tr>\r\n<tr style=\"border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px; vertical-align: top; background-color: #F7F7F7\"><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px; white-space: nowrap; background-image: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAyAAAAACCAYAAACg/LjIAAAAL0lEQVR42u3XsQ0AQAgCQHdl/xn8jxvYWB3JlTR0VJLa+OltBwAAYP6EEQAAgCsPVYVAgIJrA/sAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)\" class=\"hierarchy\"><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAAWCAYAAAABxvaqAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAB3RJTUUH3wYeFzIs1vtcMQAAAB1pVFh0Q29tbWVudAAAAAAAQ3JlYXRlZCB3aXRoIEdJTVBkLmUHAAAAE0lEQVQI12P4//8/AxMDAwNdCABMPwMo2ctnoQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: inherit\" class=\"hierarchy\"/><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAWCAYAAADJqhx8AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAB3RJTUUH3wYeFzI3XJ6V3QAAAB1pVFh0Q29tbWVudAAAAAAAQ3JlYXRlZCB3aXRoIEdJTVBkLmUHAAAANklEQVQ4y+2RsQ0AIAzDav7/2VzQwoCY4iWbZSmo1QGoUgNMghvWaIejPQW/CrrNCylIwcOCDYfLNRcNer4SAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: inherit\" class=\"hierarchy\"/><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" alt=\".\" style=\"background-color: #F7F7F7; background-color: inherit\" title=\"Data Type\" class=\"hierarchy\"/> <span title=\"BiologicallyDerivedProduct.productCategory : Broad category of this product.\">productCategory</span><a name=\"BiologicallyDerivedProduct.productCategory\"> </a></td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\"/><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\">0..1</td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\"><a href=\"datatypes.html#Coding\">Coding</a></td><td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align : left; background-color: #F7F7F7; border: 0px #F0F0F0 solid; padding:0px 4px 0px 4px\" class=\"hierarchy\">organ | tissue | fluid | cells | biologicalAgent<br/><a href=\"valueset-product-category.html\">BiologicallyDerivedProductCategory</a> (<a href=\"terminologies.html#example\" title=\"Instances are not expected or even encouraged to draw from the specified value set.
